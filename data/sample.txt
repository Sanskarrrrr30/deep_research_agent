Deep Researcher Agent - Sample Document

This is a small sample document to demonstrate the Deep Researcher Agent.
The system should be able to read this file, chunk it, embed the chunks, and
retrieve relevant pieces in response to a query.

Example content:
- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- Machine learning models can be used to create embeddings that represent
  semantic meaning of pieces of text.
- FAISS is a popular library for efficient similarity search over vectors.
- Sentence-Transformers provide pre-trained models to create embeddings.
- For PDF reading, pdfplumber can be used to extract text from pages.
