Vector databases store and search embeddings efficiently. 
They are optimized for similarity search, where the goal is to find the closest vectors 
to a given query vector. 

Popular vector databases include FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Milvus. 
These databases are commonly used in semantic search engines, recommendation systems, 
and AI applications that require fast retrieval of relevant information.
