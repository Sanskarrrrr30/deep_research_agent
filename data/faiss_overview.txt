FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library developed by Meta AI. 
It is designed for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 
FAISS enables developers to quickly find nearest neighbors in high-dimensional data, 
making it useful for applications like recommendation systems, image retrieval, and semantic search.

The library supports CPU and GPU acceleration and provides multiple indexing methods such as 
IVF (Inverted File Index), PQ (Product Quantization), and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs).
