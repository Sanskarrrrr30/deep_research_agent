Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text, images, or other data. 
In Natural Language Processing, embeddings capture semantic meaning so that words with similar meanings 
are located close together in vector space. 

For example, the words "king" and "queen" are semantically related, so their embeddings 
will be closer than "king" and "car". Popular models for generating embeddings include 
Word2Vec, GloVe, and Sentence-Transformers.
